Also note that the name of this HTML file is 'index.html'. This is both a convention but can also function to identify this script as source of the webpage. 

HTML provides the structure of web pages. Tags like <head> identify the various components that make up a webpage. These primarily affect the layout of your content. Below, the <title> tag is used by browers to display text in the tab which opens when the webpage runs.-->

In jsPsych, each plugin corresponds to a differnt type of question or trial. For instance, `jspsych-instructions.js` contains the code to execute instruction-type trials. While similar, different plugins frequently have different parameters that can be used with them, and thus require differnt syntax when constructing them. The jsPsych webpage is the best resource for finding the plugins that you need and the paramters that they require.

        Note that it is only necessary to reference the plugins for the trials that appear in your complete experiment. If, for some reason, I was developing a task that had no instructions, I would have no need to include a reference to `jspsych-instructions.js` in my code.-->

        There are many ways to associate CSS styles with elements on the webpage, we won't go into the details of those here. Just note that different methods are denoted by different symbols prepending the name of the style (e.g., '.', '#')-->

    <!-- The final language used in the construction of webpages is javaScript. This language controls the dynamic and interactive functionalty of any webpage. It makes sense then that jsPsych is a javaScript library. As a result the structure and content of your experiment will be coded in javaScript, using the jsPsych plugin.

    In the task that we demonstrate here, participants view moral vignettes which they respond to by answering multiple-choice questions, Likert scales, and numeric sliders. This demonstration allows us to showcase the basic steps and code required to create and run a simple behavioral task of the kind typically used by social psychologists. However, jsPsych allows for far greater functionality and customization than we require here. For instance, you can use javaScript and the jsPsych directory to modify any plugin. We allude to these 'advanced' features in our blog, but do not use them here.-->

        //Here, participnats are presented with an external HTML webpage, in this case `consent.html`. The function defined above is called to ensure that consent to participate has been given.

        //Some things to note:
        //The `pages` element is constructed using HTML tags that allow for some customisation of how the text appear to participants. In this instance, we have references the CSS class `isntructions`, which we defined above. This overwrites the default appearance of text in favor of left-aligned text with greater padding between the page margins and the text.
        //The `on_finish` can be used in almost any trial and is usually used to build a function that does something with the data from that trial. In all cases, this function only gets executed by jsPsych after the trial has concluded. Here, we wish to keep track of the vignettes in the order that participants saw them. So, we define a function that stores that information. Specifically, we create a variable for the data object and assign it the vignette order. The data object descibes the information that any trial stores. By default this includes information like reaction times and buttons pressed or options selected. The syntax below demonstrates how to store additional information in data so that it gets sent to our database whent he experiment ends.

        //Next, we create a loop which will repeat the same trials a set number of times, dictates by the `n_trials` variable.
        //Those of us familiar with programming will recognise the syntax for achieving this as a for loop. In JavaScript, we typically initialise a for loop by creating a sentienl or dummy variable that increments by s et amount across each itteration of the loop. In this case, `k` is that variable. We initialise k as 0 and tell the loop to run so long as K is less than the number of trial repetitions that we want. Obviously this would continue in an infinite loop if k is always 0 and n_trials is always greater than 0, so the final component in the first line of the loop, `k++`, tells JavaSctipt to increase k by 1 on each iteration of the loop.
        //As we only have one demonstration vignette, we only loop once.
